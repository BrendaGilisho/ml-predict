It's just over 2 years since I was diagnosed with #anxiety and
#depression. Today I'm taking a moment to reflect on how far I've
come since.
It's Sunday, I need a break, so I'm planning to spend as little time as
possible on the #A14...
Awake but tired. I need to sleep but my brain has other ideas...

It’s hard to say whether packing lists are making life easier or just
reinforcing how much still needs doing... #movinghouse #anxiety
Making packing lists is my new hobby... #movinghouse
At what point does keeping stuff for nostalgic reasons cross the line
into plain old hoarding...? #movinghouse
Currently in the finding-boxes-of-random-shit packing phase. I think I’m
a closet hoarder...
Can't be bothered to cook, take away on the way           #lazy

Moving stuff is bloomin’ knackering... and there’s still loads to do...
Back at the house, moving stuff. It’s so peaceful here... I ❤️
Urgh. Anxiety. FFS where does it come from?! (Breathe...)
I have too much stuff. Way, way too much... Massive purge on the
way.
Hideous traffic on the A14. Must remember to pay closer attention to
the traffic reports...
Packing and purging. Feels good
In B&amp;Q looking at internal doors. Fun times
Time to get up. So many things to do, such a busy day ahead...
It's 6                                                                   20... do I get up or lie here a little longer with my cat buddy...
There's nothing like cocktails and exhaustion to aid a good night's
sleep...
Great night out with my favourite ladies. Much needed after the past
few days. I love them so much
Sat down on the sofa for a quick rest... an hour ago. Need to move.
How much do I want pizza right now...?
I will always love you.

Such a busy day ahead. I need to focus but I'm feeling on the edge of
derailment right now.
Even now the smallest thing still makes my heart break. I doesn't feel
like that ever goes away.
Why is choosing a curtain pole suddenly so confusing? Too. Many.
Choices. And yes, I know this isn't a 'real' problem.
Completed on my house. Got the keys. What a fab day! Whoop!

On October 8th, 2014 I was diagnosed with depression. It's a very
serious thing, but I still choose to hide it behind my fake smiles.
Life is just an endless labyrinth of pain and sorrow that we walk through
trying to find happiness. For me, happiness is impossible to gain.

what I do I suggest that you either don't respond or suck it up.;)

GONNA FUCKING CALL YOU OUT. STOP TRYING TO MAKE SHIT
EVEN WORSE!!! -.-
My wrist? COVERED &amp; SOAKED in blood. With my tears on top
of it.
I never blamed SHIT on you. If I blame anyone, its myself. *cuts*
Most of the people that I subtweet about dont even have Twitter, so
stop thinking I'm talking about you. Kay?
You dont realize how much I feel like SHIT now.
I HATE MYSELF. *cuts, cuts, and cuts constantly*
i hate that ive made you hurt yourself as much as i hurt myself. *cuts*
i hate the fact that ive caused you so much pain. *cuts*
i hate the fact that i just let go of the one who cared most. *cuts*
i hate the fact that you kept this from me. *cuts*

Cutting is like smoking. Once you start, it's hard to stop &lt;3
But you know me. #ForeverAFuckUp
I'm not encouraging you to do it though....
IT. FEELS. AWESOME &lt;3
It burns more and you bleed more....
If you get your arm wet in the shower, dry it off with a towel still in the
shower and then take a pair of wet, then dry scissors....
I'm not encouraging you, but...
I learned something my fellow cutters...
let me bleed...
I love Justin, I do. But I wouldn't do that for him..
Not Bieber.
FOR MY OWN REASONS.
But I have more...
At all.
That stuffs not funny.
Whatever.
He's got so many Beliebers cutting now.
I can't believe Justin didn't say anything about that.
"Bieber means more to me than my wrist." WHAT?! Once you cut, it's
hard to stop -.-

hesitate to ask me, I'll always be happy to help!

of support in large quantities still makes a big difference

I ask her what her fav outfit was and she says she doesn't know the
name of the girl but she can draw it
then I ask how she knew about cosplay and she says "I really like
anime girl outfits and I used to cosplay myself"
she says 2 weeks AND THAT SHE'LL DO IT FOR FREE
so we talk out all the details and she says she'll even make me her
thighhigh boots and glasses and then I ask how long it'll take her
then she pulls up a paper and starts drawing her outfit and asking me
all these questions about it http                                             //t.co/MKzm0xkysb
at that point I started freaking out like she actually knows homura and
all the megukas
now I ask if she'd make me a cosplay of homura and she says "is that
the emo girl from the madoka anime?"
turns out my mom is a total weeb
she took out her iPad and showed me a collection of manga and anime
and Love Live of all things
I asked if she knew what cosplaying was and she said yes, then I
asked if she was familiar with anime and she got really offended
already was pretty happy about that but I decided to test her promise
and her sewing skills
at the end of the talk she says she fully accepts who I am and will
support me in any way possible and a year before she kicked me out
its late night and she starts asking me about a bunch of trans stuff and I
just answer her honestly
the reason I was supposed to go see my mom was she wanted to talk
to me about something face to face
I was already in awe over that but the day got even better
I asked him about it and he said hes really into 90s anime and jp
culture
turns out my dad has a whole collection of doujins under his bed,
mostly from the 90s
as I walk into my dads bedroom to get my clothes I turn to look at him
and he's literally reading a doujin
so I'm about to leave to my moms house but I realised I'd probably
stay there for 2 nights instead of one so I decided to get extra clothes
this is the same story I tried to tell last week but I didn't because I was
feeling horrible
I have to wait until 14 for my appointment so story time
heading to the trans clinic now, hopefully I'll bring back some good
news

@Pendant_kun I got my flight ticket super early and it only cost me me
550$~ as opposed to 1300$~ if I waited until now to get it
@Pendant_kun I do because I still have a pretty massive time frame to
get everything done by, I just want to get things of of the way ASAP
@Pendant_kun -depending on when it's processed it'll either arrive in 5
or 25 days and so far I've unlucky and only gotten the 25 day cycle
@Pendant_kun these are USPS standards of shipping. The way it
works for my area is that if I order something- http                        //t.co/hqoGETmXyC

anything and then waiting for USPS is like icing on waiting cake

@PrincessAsh1ey ahh good for you then, I wish you the best of luck
going back to school!
@PrincessAsh1ey oh nice a tech related job will pay much better for
sure, I just hope you have some interest in being a computer tecnitician
@soft_homura I hate to ask but could you give an example of one, I'm
really curious now
@PrincessAsh1ey how do you make sufficient money to support
yourself then?
@soft_homura ahh well you probably can't escape from that stuff even
if you were to leave tumblr completely, it'll always pop up somewhere
@PrincessAsh1ey well I imagine life isn't so different from say age 23,
just with more responsibilities and a better job perhaps
@soft_homura what's the issue with your dash? is there stuff that
triggers you or??
@PrincessAsh1ey oh wow, you're the oldest trans person I've ever
talked to! I wonder what life is like at that age...
@soft_homura idk then I guess unfollow some people but don't delete,
you'll probably regret it later on
@soft_homura I get that urge too but I've done it a couple of times and
each time I regret it sooo
@PrincessAsh1ey if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
@PrincessAsh1ey Your welcome and I'm sure it is! I wish I could have
started sooner but it shouldn't be much longer until I start HRT.
@PrincessAsh1ey Congratulations! I have no idea who you are but I'm
really happy for you! It must feel great finally having proper boobs.

@satsukitv thank u!!!!!!
@satsukitv super excited, I'll finally get to see my gf (ldr) and live with
one of my best friends and finally be back in europe and and
@satsukitv moving to the uk in march
@satsukitv its ok, in a couple of months it won't matter anymore
@satsukitv mhm and the holidays usually are pretty stressful at least in
my case
@aartorias not rly but ok
@satsukitv I need to get better too but lately theres been so much
other stuff on my mind and plus my ADHD has been hard to control as
well
@_fawky bring up some info on transitioning and show her some
transitions so she gets an idea
@satsukitv tru. I always feel so bad taking people to the city, I never
know what to do then go back home a think of a million things to do
@_fawky how'd she react?
@satsukitv that would be nice, we could go to the city and do nothing
together
@satsukitv still so far though                                              (
@satsukitv westchester
@satsukitv only because you asked nicely and because albany is way
too far away from where I live
@vividgrim do you have like artist anxiety or something? I don't know
of any mental illness driving you to claw at your skin
@satsukitv I think the only other place would be at your place if I was a
thief
@_fawky have you done any of the stuff we talked about on steam that
one day?
@satsukitv probably at a coffee shop or supermarket
@_fawky you know what I meant
@vividgrim well not that unhappy but just a displeasure with your
completely work I mean
@vividgrim I think most artists feel that way, I know I do
@_fawky seriously though, just do stuff

@unknownoddity @Baziu_ @CosmicLin just try to reflect on how
much you've changed as a person over the course of 2014 and stay
positive
@unknownoddity @Baziu_ @CosmicLin I got 2 hours of sleep due to

@Baziu_ @CosmicLin @unknownoddity that's a pretty big deal and a

I only hope that I can give back in 2015 as much I've been given
without all of you I wouldn't be alive, you've shaped my life into what it
is now
above all else I'm really thankful for the friends I made this year
@seqilol under an hour?
2014 started off pretty horribly for me but ended really well
what matters is what you take away from experience, not experience
itself
the one thing I learned that stands out the most to me is that it doesn't
matter how something starts, what matters is how it ends
what a roller coaster this year has been
reflecting on 2014

I've been diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder,PTSD,OCD. I
struggle with anxiety,panic attacks,depression.I'm open about that.
Those hospitalizations,medications, and weekly therapy have saved
my life.
I've been in and out of hospitals, had electroconvulsive therapy, been
on a lot of meds, and been in therapy for almost 13 years now.
I take medication for my mental illness just as someone would take
medication for a physical ailment. No shame in that.
Mental health is just as important as physical health.People aren't
ashamed of physical illness,why's it any different for mental illness?
It's mental health month! So if you see a lot of tweets from me about
mental illness you'll know why.

No recollection of what I did the past 2 hours so I have to reorient

Unless the audience member is at public disturbance level,u know?I've
heard of people still performing through worse.Deal with it offstage.
So I'm always glad when performers continue with the show instead of
breaking character and yelling at an audience member.
I think stopping a performance for a rude (but not unruly) audience
member would be more distracting than someone texting.

probably not the way to go.
Here's a tip: don't compare audience size&amp;reactions and whether
one group "got" the show on social media where audience members
can see.
I have Liar Liar on DVD but inexplicably it only plays in French so I'm
happy it's on tv tonight. My French isn't what it used to be.
Sometimes I want to take a road trip&amp;collect my
thoughts&amp;decide where to go next in life. Then I'm like nah I'm
afraid to leave my house.
If you're in the NOVA area go see the @SPlaymakers Noises Off.
Fantastic show, great set, fabulous cast and crew.
Life is too short to be around people you can't stand if you don't have
to be around them. You don't owe anyone small talk.
Yes, I know I smell like sunscreen. I had to walk to the car. I'm a

Just because something worked for you doesn't mean it will work for
everyone. It's not one size fits all.

If you feel the need to constantly assure someone you're a
good,nice,trustworthy person, then you probably aren't.
I would hope that anyone who knows me would feel they could talk to
me about their experience,survivor to survivor.there r people who care.
I wonder how many other survivors feel they can't share their
stories&amp;try to spread awareness but feel silenced for any reason.
I have a sleepy diaper dog. http                                           //t.co/5EgBEN45xj
And to anyone who supports survivors or spreads awareness,thank
you for giving survivors an outlet and a way to be heard.
Most importantly bear in mind it doesn't matter what u think of what
happened to them.their experiences and feelings are valid.
If they trust you enough to open up to you,do not misuse that trust.It's
hard enough for survivors to feel like they can talk about it.
So if somebody discloses to you that they were abused,listen to
them.Don't act as an investigator. Do not tell them they should be over
it
It is important for victims of sexual abuse to be heard and feel like they
have a right to their feelings no matter what happened or when.

years ago, can u follow back so I can private msg u? I need advice.
@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution there's no brain test
for having depression that I am aware of but I was diagnosed
@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution it's caused by a
variety of factors. Lifestyle and diet are some factors.
@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution actually no one is
sure where depression comes from. Serotonin thing is just a theory I
think.

@VeganRevoIution @ayykaitlyn_ when did "triggering" become an
excuse to stop saying the truth? Let's keep everyone in a fairytale
bubble
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution horse meat is sold to other countries
and everyone here is "aw, don't eat horses?!" While chowing down on
cows
@Viiictttoriia @VeganRevoIution like not only can they not handle it,
they misinterpret and misconstrue it so bad it's like?! Wut?!?
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution I kno plenty of people who love
animals and still eat them.theres a better way though.morals aligning
w/beliefs
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution cognitive dissonance.We're
conditioned to love certain animals as pets and certain are food.its diff
everywhere
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution if u care more about cows than
people I want you to know you don't have to eat them.That's moral
schizophrenia
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution see you still have compassion left!
You don't need to eat animals to survive                                  ) let them keep their sparkle
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution eating meat is still killing the animal
that wanted to live a full life like you and I
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution if the end game is that the dairy
cows still die when they're of no use to you, PETA has nothing to do
w/this
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution I believe you dont see abuse the
same way I do.you might think the cows are happy?but think about if it
was you
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution for veal. Milked til they can't anymore
and are useless. Confined
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution so did the cows tell you themselves
they want to be artificially inseminated. Birth calves to be taken away
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution you kill things you love? The family
pet? Your little sister? You can't love someone and then kill them
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution and what is actually disgusting is the
abuse torture and killing of animals.
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution its not saying oh anyone w an eating
disorder is a bad person. Showing you that they don't need to abuse
back
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution no. People can overcome eating
disorders without eating meat (abusing animals)
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution you can defend a human abuse
victim while still believing they shouldn'tbe abusing animals.actually
makes sense
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution then you might relate to the animals
being abused a little more one would think. I speak up for those who
can't
@itsmeolyavi @Laiqalasse a cow is a pig is a cat is a dog. They're all
the same. Why love one but eat the other?

want it to be the way it used to be!!

years. what is called "country" today shouldn't be classified as country

the older stuff is the true definition of country music

@HeatherHordubay ok. will do that

either be the best feeling ever or the wort feeling ever

feel the same way...

"Pissed off" seems to be my new default. Maybe my inner bitch has
finally developed! Or maybe people just fucking suck.
So now we're back to our loveable (albeit slightly leaky) fur baby. I will

Decided to stop cats meds because it stressed her out. She gets a lot
of her personality from bf, but she gets her ability to cope from me!

clinical depression
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd it's super hard sometimes though
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso yes. Dwelling on the positive is much
more fun
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd haha. I'd have to do some more
research. I'm gonna be a history major next semester so this is like
porn to me
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd it was only like three generations ago
so at pretty recentish
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd idk but y'know. It makes sense.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd yeah well that's why my mom's side
doesn't drink.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd that's all I know but when I found out I
was like wow I come from class.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd uh well. Because my great grandpa's
dad made moonshine during Prohibition and they wanted to get away
from that
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso funny story it's why my maternal
grandma's dad's family relocated from AL to AR
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd though tbh I'm descended from illegal
moonshine makers so I dunno how I ended up being such a lightweight

@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso I have Irish in me but not enough
apparently.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso oh god an entire bottle would knock
me out cold.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso probably don't wanna know.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd hangover was not worth it man.
Never drank since.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd yeah. I once went to a fancy
restaurant, barely drank a thing. My friend had to steady me back to
the car.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd I can get tipsy after a sip of white
wine. So yeah. I am.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd I've never actually experienced
whiskey.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso I have a kerig or however you spell it
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd eh well I made it a few hours ago. It
was too hot for hot coffee earlier.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso this coffee is actually making me
sleepy.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd besides the reign of Michael Ann,
kitchen Nazi is almost over. Thankfully.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd well I have coffee it'll have to replace
alcohol.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd no. My family celebrates it on
Christmas Eve because my dad works on Christmas
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso this conversation has happened at
least three times today.
@GenevieveVerso "Paige you aren't doing this right" "then why don't
YOU do it Michael Ann?" "I'm helping mom with dinner" Helllllp

off the red flag for me. Heellll no.

Welp. After the blood bank I stumbled upon I decided I've had enough
of bugs tonight. Anyone doing anything fun?
This game has been potting bugs at me for the past hour. Bring it.
Miralurks scare me but not as much as those giant ass mosquitos
I hate giant bugs. Why does it always have to be giant bugs?

Finally hit level 50. Score.

@azarkansero @TheFuxedos well actually it's be impossible since
there's a mean dog guarding goodneighbor. Not that I made someone
try...

minutes to actually get to Hancock.

@MissLusyd I'll be fine. I just need to not think about my job for 11
days.
@MissLusyd dude I don't even drink and today made me want to start.
While I was away, my sister had succeeded in getting Hancock as a
companion and stealing his outfit.

We shouldn't be treated like this especially since we were just doing
our jobs.
I am so stressed out now for me and my coworker's mental well being.
Seriously. In the 4 years I've known her I've never seen her cry.
I am *so* sick of being perceived as not doing anything when I do
everything I'm told and more. It drives me insane.
I mean it's not like I made three lists, restocked the entire candy
section and dusted the entire store. Pshh.
BUT since we made her wait thirty minutes for our pizza I apparently
did NOTHING for the past few days except sit on my ass.
and seriously I tried my hardest to have everything done on her damn
list by the time she got there. And it was to an extent.
BUT. Apparently since we made her wait thirty minutes to get our pizza
that was all invalidated. We didn't do anything. Allegedly.
We ended up making about $300 in thirty minutes and that was pretty
cool.
I mean EVERYONE decided to come in at that time and people were
super needy and we were doing the best we could tbh.
She was supposed to pick up pizza and we were supposed to order it
but we got slammed and there was no way for us to get to the phones.
Anyway. My boss made my coworker cry and me pissed beyond belief.
ughh...yeah shit just hit the fan.
UGH MY BOSS IS LETTING US CLOSE AT 1                                     30! MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME

@azarkansero it's okay, hon. *pat* I won't let her do anything to him.
When she first met Hancock she burst out into giggles and said "is this
the guy that can overdose if you give him too many drugs?"
She's gonna do the quest that allows you to recruit Hancock. Aw yiss.

@techiem2 we have signs. we have highlighted signs. These people
have been shopping with us for years. THEY KNOW about the fees.
this drives me insane. Seriously.
The cafeteria ALSO charges extra for low transactions. We do not,
hence the limit. We would make no money off a $1.75 purchase on a
card.
The cafeteria jacked up their prices. We did not. They can do whatever
they want since they raised to mirror the bank fees.
I will explain. We would not make any money off a low transaction
because the bank fees are too damn high.
so when I say "We're not the cafeteria. I can't put $1.75 on your card""
do NOT give me the bitchface.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos nah nevermind. I deleted it. my feed
is lying to me.
why do people think we're gonna follow the rules of the hospital
cafeteria? They're not state run. We are We still enforce the $3 card
limit
@GenevieveVerso we don't sell enough books.

@GenevieveVerso especially since I allegedly never do it right.
@GenevieveVerso ugh it is. actually this is unmaintained. I still need to

@GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l I was referring to the epic autocorrect
mistake made by Megan
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l [sorry I had to]
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l THATS WHAT SHE SAID
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l it's hard having a Midwestern accent in the
south, man.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l I have trouble saying "Asiago"
FINALLY got Valentine's companion perk. Welp. Time to stop playing
for today.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l actually northwest Louisiana but AR sounded
less dignified.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l oh that too. I was thinking of the south
Arkansas dialect
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
@liz_smith333 @Tauri3l here in the south we call them spuds.
Because we can't say potato
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @liz_smith333 @GenevieveVerso
@Tauri3l like I said last night babies don't know how to people yet.
@NoahClue it's quite adorable they snuggle and everything. It's the
other cats she has problems with.
@NoahClue actually she did have a twin but I couldn't get her. And FYI
the puppy looooves her.

@TheFuxedos omg one sec
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333
@TheFuxedos can I send him badly drawn pictures of boobs instead?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333
@TheFuxedos I DONT.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333
@TheFuxedos poor guy.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333
@TheFuxedos I'm sure modifications are available
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos I
have an album saved on Spotify but i have yet to listen to it. Next
delivery run.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos
what did they ever do to you!?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos
you must! For the kittens.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos

@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos bit
of both really.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos
stayed for the weird ass conversations.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos I'm
just here for the lols.
@MissLusyd @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso
yeah the mayor doesn't need his ego stroked too much. He gets
"ideas"
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l ..did I say something wrong?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l dude I'm just upset because it would've made a great story
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l Bethesda is kink shaming me.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l WHY WONT NICK LOVE ME
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l tbh he was my second choice. My first choice was
unavailable *sobs*
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l I'd do* damn phone.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l is so it with you I I knew the terms.
@liz_smith333 @GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l he comes and goes. It's a thing.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a
different set of morals
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a
different set of morals
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l dude I've been thinking about this while I play.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l I could actually use fallout as an example with factions and
such.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l different societies have different concepts of right and wrong.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l well of course. A moral compass is constructed by society.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l but still!
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l it could go both ways. Babies don't know how to people yet.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l she took it to the place where it needed to go. GENIUS.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l holy shit you're right
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l anyway have we fully defined twat nugget yet?
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l not to mention an entire wall of pens.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l we have a wide selection of chocolate and energy bars.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l dude it is. Our candy section is ridiculously massive and it
takes all day.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l I should be shelving books not act as a living vending
machine.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l restocking candy is mine. I work in a med school bookstore.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l oh you poor girl. I'm actually pretty lucky as far as retail jobs
go tbh.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l sales and clearance racks are my own personal brand of
hell.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l I work retail, I'm well aware there is no escape.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l those who put their money on the counter and leave...
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l I always stayed home where ya safe from the twat nuggets
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l thank god I work for the state and my store never has to do
Black Friday.
@liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l
@GenevieveVerso you started this oh great leader
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l aka what should be common sense but isn't.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l nah, since it's a philosophy by a religion. We don't worship
the twat nugget
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos
@Tauri3l a good number of my customers are twat nuggets.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd
@Tauri3l I might adhere to the twat nugget philosophy. It sounds very
wise.
It's so rare that all four of us are here upstairs. Tali has so many people
to smell during the movie.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l Plato,
Betham, Mills. Got it.
Finally convinced dad that we only needed to watch the original trilogy.
Success.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I've never
actually studied it. I probably will eventually. Sounds like my kinda
thing.
Nick Valentine better get max approval after this damn quest. I
DESERVE IT
Running backwards and shooting aimlessly is a strategy I use waaaay
too often.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I may not
know anything about the subject but damn I'll try to contribute.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos do I really
want to answer that?
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso only way
accepted.
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso sometimes
you gotta go deep, man.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos Welp. I'm powerless.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd which I don't. They
tried that a few years back didn't stick.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso ahhhh if only it were
that simple.
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso actually completely
impossible to be honest.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso eh. It honestly is what
we make of it. My beliefs are kinda hard to summarize.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso Same actually. Twitter
is not made for theological discussions
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos wait I do. So God's
will is chair fights?
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos ...I legit do not know
how to respond to that.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos so classy because
divine beings can do whatever they want? Pshh
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos cmon now surely it'd
be classier than that. Surely.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I know. I work in retail. I KNOW.
@GenevieveVerso if I were truly bright I wouldn't have gotten so lost in
this stupid game just now.
@TheFuxedos another one? I thought that event was last
thanksgiving.
@GenevieveVerso oh pshh. Not really.
@GenevieveVerso yeah once I get one of those fancy Masters
degrees I can move out. Only just got an associates so it'll be awhile.
@GenevieveVerso I say I'm independent while living rent free at my
parents house so eh?
@GenevieveVerso what can I say I'm an independent woman?
@GenevieveVerso eh. I'll just try to get one of those degree things and
see if I can get one of those job things
@GenevieveVerso yeah. I'm fresh out of those.
@GenevieveVerso I dot actually get too much attention. Mostly
because I don't go anywhere.
@GenevieveVerso yeah the big blue doe eyes don't exactly help with
scariness.
@GenevieveVerso yeah. We seem to be in the same boat. I'm actually
5'2 and look barely legal so if you actually have an arsenal can we
share
@GenevieveVerso scary guy friends are a must while out in public
@GenevieveVerso aaaaand this is why I don't interact with people
outside the Internet.
@MissLusyd not too much a pie person. Or a tea person. I have very
plain tastes.
@MissLusyd is it sweet and delicious?
@MissLusyd I don't drink but that looks amazing.
@GenevieveVerso daw thanks. ~&lt;3
@GenevieveVerso personally I think I look like I'm 12 but y'know.
@GenevieveVerso eh. Like I said I'm mostly doing this for my health.
@GenevieveVerso I'm not. I'm jus really really short and 170 may not
be a lot to some people but I SHOULD be 125
@GenevieveVerso dude I'm not one of them. I've never broken a bone
in my life.
@GenevieveVerso actually there's a legit reason                             I broke my toe last year by standing on it. My bones can't handle being this heavy.
@GenevieveVerso but I COULD have a perfect ass and be even cuter.
@GenevieveVerso it's the booty. I need to get rid of it. https             //t.co/8mEQ2ePgKk
@GenevieveVerso that's sweet but I am on the chubby side and my
body needs to be thinner to be healthy. Delicate bones, y'see.
@ProfessorOtaku too pure...too precious for this world.
@ProfessorOtaku ...look I am well aware that I am tiny and chubby but
I can have dreams.
@ProfessorOtaku DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME
One of these days I will do enough sit ups to have abs of steel. *sigh*
why is exercising so haaaaaaard
No snuggles until princess Tali has filled her quota of kitty fetch. No
sleeping either unless you want your face licked
Princess Tali DEMANDS to play kitty fetch. Or else she will make sad
crying noises.
@PikaHikariKT they're all in my bed somewhere.
Tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where I have
none because she has lost most of them.
No it doesn't matter what you're doing or what time it is. You will play
Kitty fetch when Kitty wants to play Kitty fetch.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @azarkansero blech
@MissLusyd not to mention most likely fatal. HEYO.
@MissLusyd oh god. I dunno. Can we really top car fucking?
@MissLusyd good! Now we can move on to something more fun!
@MissLusyd just remember not everyone sucks. I know it's hard.
Especially since I've cut myself off from actual people
@MissLusyd I don't *actually* follow my own advice though.
@MissLusyd am I sounding preachy? I just like helping people.
@MissLusyd you should carry yourself in a way as such. Like you
shouldn't change anything except how you think about yourself.
@MissLusyd well the way I see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that,
there's a possibility they do. Fuck them. You ARE a person and-
@MissLusyd it could be. Personally I think it looks awesome but
different is treated differently by the public
@MissLusyd I hate people sometimes.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd tear him to pieces. Then screenshot it and
show us.
@MissLusyd seriously? If you don't mind me asking, why?
@MissLusyd we all have our coping mechanisms. And I think no
human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.
@MissLusyd I bet. Destroying men's concept of existence sounds so
badass tbh.
@MissLusyd ahh yes. I wasn't too good at messing with them, my
trolling techniques are too uncreative. I'm sure you're a master at it.
@MissLusyd yeah after the 50thish one I was bored. It's like the same
guy was messaging me from different accounts
@MissLusyd I always got the "lonely gamer" types.
@MissLusyd mine was too at first but it stopped being funny after a
few months so I stopped.
@MissLusyd see that's why I left those sites years ago. I am a weird
creepy guy magnet as well.
@MissLusyd oh god. That's terrifying.
@LonerDreamer eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing
it for her
@LonerDreamer well she just got done with finals. I think she's
exercising pent up rage. It's hard being an engineering major
apparently
@LonerDreamer she also ditches him frequently and "accidentally"
shoots him. Yet she won't change companions for some reason
@LonerDreamer also everytime he complains about her hoarding she
changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.
@LonerDreamer yeah I vaguely remember him in fallout 3. It's been a
few years but it's really recent for her. The memories are still fresh
@LonerDreamer @PikaHikariKT I shudder at the thought of if she
finds one even more ridiculous looking.
@tskimoongoddess I'm too nice to do that. Such a shame.
@tskimoongoddess she's just incredibly tacky with looting and
extorting caps. Also underleveled like 70% of the time.
@PikaHikariKT also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. Push him
off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc.
@PikaHikariKT I should've taken a picture of the hat of shame, then.
I have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it's
amazing
Also there's the fact that she makes MacCready wear the "hat of
shame" for "being a turd in Fallout 3"
Y'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games?
She makes all of them because why not
I think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing
it if not more.
Sleepy kitty. https                                                       //t.co/vcT9xphXiN
@LonerDreamer wellllll actually you can't change his clothes until his
exile apparently. danse'
@LonerDreamer I will definitely take pictures.
my sister says she's gonna dress everyone like that. https                //t.co/tlv5GfV9nY

sparkling personality?

@azarkansero @TheFuxedos that's terrible! Why would he do such a
thing?
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd

@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
you too? We're having a sale and it's failing miserably
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
please keep them rolling it's the only thing keeping me awake right
now.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
ugh I'd join in but I'm multitasking.

...have I told you that I love you already? Because I do.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
how long are we gonna keep the car thing up?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos
we are pretty hot aren't we?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos
I would marry us.

@BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
...where..HOW did you find that?
@BattleMonkeyz eh we had a good sale last week so eh?
"I'm running away and never coming back" "Ok. I'm burning down the
store, is that okay?" "Pshh I get paid regardless, so sure"
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
that screenshot says it all. Beautiful.
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
it honestly looks like the car equivalent of a tricycle
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
look I didn't even know~loving~ cars was possible til last night.
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos
omaigawd that's awesome.
I told my boss it MIGHT be the worst sale ever and she's like "whaddya
mean MIGHT be. If I fall asleep, you can hit me"
ohmaigawd this is the worst sale in the history of sales.
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos i
honestly don't know what that is.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I'm just sorry I missed the
really great/terrible ones. Ah, well. I had to sleep.
Sooooo...the sale is a complete failure.

I feel oodles better. Still not 100% but some recovery is better than no
recovery.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I wake up to a bunch of
car puns. You guys are great.
Back to bed. Night folks.
@MissLusyd sorry. I'm on a diet and my mother is being my enforcer.
*sigh*
@MissLusyd oh yeah. That too.
Awwww my kitty wants in. Guess my parents don't give enough belly
rubs.
@MissLusyd my mother would take one look at that and be like "that's
too many calories why are you drinking that?"
@MissLusyd """""""""""healthy""""""""""
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero seriously I'll probably be
back in an hour. My insomnia is predictable
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero and with that. I should
go to bed. I'll probably be awake in a couple of hours. It happens.
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I should
be sorry. I'm not. This was a great way to spend a Thursday night.
@Tory_B_Martin @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that was
the plan actually
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yup. Guess I'm staying up.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero actually not the weirdest thing I've heard
of after the car conversation
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I should go to bed but I probably won't.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero weird-er I suppose
@azarkansero @MissLusyd THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO
BE KNOWN FOR
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I got one too https                              //t.co/NSrvYtLtno

@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos fine. I'd fuck a Lexus.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am a CHILLLD
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am TOO PURE to
disclose this information
@MissLusyd @azarkansero or..."Sinnin' wagon"? :D
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos this might be the strangest
conversation of my 24 1/2 years of life
@MissLusyd @azarkansero "Danny if you could fuck a car, what
would you fuck?"
@MissLusyd @azarkansero ...actually The pure thing is mostly an act.
Mostly.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero TOOO PURE I AM.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd that is a door we should leave locked.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero NO. I AM TOO PURE TO SEE IT
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I'm surprised there isn't actual footage of
this. Guys really do love their cars. No. I don't want to actually see
@MissLusyd @azarkansero what if the Volkswagen doesn't get his
motor running?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero well I assume he's dead.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh god what is wrong with us the tears
are back
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yeah but I mean fatally exploding.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yup. I can see it.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero MAYBE HE LIKES THE DANGER OF
STICKING HIS DICK IN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT EXPLODE
@MissLusyd @azarkansero unless the condom is also metal with
some sort of insulation coating
@MissLusyd @azarkansero oh god I'm crying
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wouldn't that like...I dunno..burn a dick
off?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wait. Is the car on during the banging?
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I started at exhaust and then my brain
died.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I dunno if we can top "burnin' rubber"
@MissLusyd @azarkansero you are REALLY good at this
@azarkansero @MissLusyd for my own personal amusement you
should do this
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh my god. Block that boy asap
@azarkansero @MissLusyd wait. What. This is why I don't do
facebook
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I can't taste food atm so everything is meh
@MissLusyd @azarkansero nah it's a whole conversion process. I
assume. I dunno.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd nope. That is a public service. The
opposite of sin.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yes. I am a sinnamon roll without the sin.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I'm too pure and innocent to generate sin
so idk
@azarkansero WHY CANT YOU TUNE TO C LIKE A NORMAL
PERSON
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I AM SO BORED GUYS
@azarkansero like the whole b flat thing? A transposing nightmare.
@azarkansero yeaaaaaah I am the worst brass player in the history of
brass players. Thing is, you guys are tuned differently and it
THROWSME
@azarkansero string instruments are a series of half and whole steps.
If you know the string names you're halfway there.
@azarkansero otherwise it seems braggy
@azarkansero thing is, it's very misleading. I feel the need to explain
that if you know one string instrument you know most of them.
@azarkansero I can't stress enough how mediocre I am music wise.
@azarkansero like I said. Not really impressive.
@azarkansero I was a music Ed major like four years ago. That's why.
Also I have a mezzo soprano vocal range.
@azarkansero a mandolin is a violin with frets. I also play guitar, piano,
and I've been instructed in trumpet and baritone
@azarkansero Violin, viola, cello, and bass. All part of the same family
@azarkansero it's a lot less impressive than it sounds. Seriously.
@azarkansero I used to doodle but I got in trouble for it.
@azarkansero can't write, never trained properly to draw. I'm a
mediocre musician who can barely play 9 instruments. Can't contribute
much.
@MissLusyd ah. I dislike the taste of alcohol so I never drink.
@azarkansero eh. She kinda blended in the background to me.
@azarkansero I found a one shot that explored it and I wanted it to be
longer. It's a shame I can't write.
@MissLusyd don't get too hammered, mmkay?
@azarkansero ah, Tumblr. Well, I dot see too much about piper but I
see a LOT of Hancock
@azarkansero also it's possible the SS met Prewar Nick since she was
a lawyer
@azarkansero I reallyreally wanted to romance Nick though. It fits.
He's out of time...she's out of time.
@azarkansero Tbh I WAS gonna romance Macready but Hancock won
me over
@azarkansero ughhhh I was so mad
@azarkansero *boring
@azarkansero Hancock is second and I'll use Deacon and Piper a lot.
Macready complains too much and the others are prong
@azarkansero Nick. Nick is the best. Hands down. I'm only romancing
Hancock because Nick is unavailable.
@BattleMonkeyz yeah there's only three of us and 2 registers.
@azarkansero she's so funny.
@azarkansero I'm actually a pretty silent player. I'll yell at companions
and talk to the screen but my sister should stream, tbh.
@BattleMonkeyz yes less shit is good. Hopefully I'm not running the
sale solo like last week.
@azarkansero it was less badass because a) she's wearing the outfit
with yellow shorts and b) she screams a lot
@MissLusyd ...having fun?                                                  D
@BattleMonkeyz had to go home early because I felt like shit. I rested,
still feel like shit but less shit.
@BattleMonkeyz trying to get healthy before the big sale tomorrow.
@Arcadyagami I CANT STOP PLAYING. There's so much todo.
@azarkansero she's level 5, has no ammo and armed with a machete.
@azarkansero I'm jealous. I was watching my sister play for awhile
which was probably the funniest thing I've seen in awhile.
So since I have been cut off from Fallout 4, I have nothing to do.
What's up guys?
I don't think I can sit through Hayden Christensen's acting ever again.
I'm sorry, father.
But my dad INSISTS we watch the prequels because "we must
prepare".
Of course I'll join once they start the original.
So my sister is home and my dad has roped her into watching all six
Star Wars movies. In "chronological" order. Hahahahahaha
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tory_B_Martin @TheFuxedos aw
damn. I always miss the fun stuff.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @TheFuxedos
what'd I miss?

@azarkansero I dunno I'm not too big on thrift store chic
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero oh god I bet it felt good to get rid of that asshole.
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero sweeeeeet
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero oh god we can do that?
@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero pshh I just picked a ton of locks. Got his full approval a
few days ago.
@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero I've actually never used it, I just collected it for extra
caps.

@azarkansero *find
@TheFuxedos @Tauri3l @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero I'm fresh out. Glue is hard to god dammit.
Still feeling under the weather but that's nothing Fallout 4 and a sweet
ball of fluff can't cure. https                                            //t.co/XZp58nWfnL
@azarkansero YOU SCARED ME FOR NOTHING I WENT BACK TO
SANCTUARY AND HE WAS FINE. I took the chems from him, yknow.
Just in case.
Poor woman. It's her first day.
Y'know I'm more annoyed with the customer in front of me than the
cashier
@NoahClue we're having a sale tomorrow so I need to be on top
shape
@NoahClue less things to make me feel worse. I already feel pretty
awful
@azarkansero in my mind, no pet is as cool as Tali
I was pathetic enough to be sent home. Now I have til 8am tomorrow
to actually get better.
@azarkansero aw! How pretty!
@azarkansero be warned                                                     I'm obsessed with her.
@azarkansero yes she does.

@MissLusyd yeah earlier this week I was completely stopped up from
one whiff of this one lady's perfume. Ah, retail.
@MissLusyd The swamps of Northwest Louisiana has many many
many things flying in the air.
@MissLusyd yes you do seem knowledgeable in the subject. I don't
usually, my main problem is seasonal allergies which Claritin fixes.
@MissLusyd I'm pretty sure it's dry sinus. I'm not sniffly at all.
@MissLusyd Pshh. I work next to a hospital, I'm bound to get sick
occasionally.
@MissLusyd dude as long as I don't have to drink it it's cool.
@MissLusyd I'll try it if I end up staying over lunch. It's pretty
miserable.
@MissLusyd we do have those. Might do that if boss lady won't let me
go home.
@MissLusyd haha well ironically I'm stuck at a medical school
bookstore and we have none of that in our drug section.
@MissLusyd I have no idea. My throat hurts too. I think it's dry sinus or
something since I feel pressure and junk.
I asked to go home but I never got a straight answer. Welp. Guess I'm
staying here.
I'm not even sniffly. the top of my nose feels raw when I breathe
through it and it's miserable.
My sinuses hate me.
My sinuses hate me.
It feels like I JUST left this god damn store.
Immediately regretting my insomnia-driven late night chatter with the
ghoulettes except not really. Totes worth the sleepiness.
Sleep attempt number 4. Lessdothis
@tskimoongoddess @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l
@azarkansero night new ghoulette friends.

AHEAD OF YOU

@Tauri3l I won't.
@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @azarkansero
@tskimoongoddess night new friend!
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess
@Tauri3l look if you're trying to start a cult here I'm out.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess
@Tauri3l SHIIIIIIIT I LEFT HIM AT SANCTUARY WITH ALL OF MY
CHEMS
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess
@Tauri3l OH CRAP. I JUST REALIZED I GAVE HIM ALL OF MY
CHEMS. SHITSHITSHIT
@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess
@azarkansero but he is the glue that brought us all together!
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l
@TheFuxedos my Hancock wears a vault suit. We're twins.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess
@Tauri3l OHHHHHHHH! BURN
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l
@TheFuxedos I ended up stealing that actually. It's a shame I can't
wear it though.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l
@TheFuxedos I gave him a good verbal thrashing before Hancock
finished him off.
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l
@azarkansero let's hope you still think that a week from now.
Ghoulettes multiply.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l
@TheFuxedos it was a beautiful shank you should've waited.
@MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @azarkansero
@TheFuxedos he fed the ghoulettes. I'm sure he expected this.
I'd fall asleep again but something furry and adorable is trying to push
me off the bed.
The thing about passing out at 9                                          30 is that you end up waking up again at 10                                                                                   40...an

@MissLusyd I was asleep for all of that. Damn responsible adult sleep
schedule.
@azarkansero @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess

poor poor Mary Ann helped this woman for an hour while we went
about our business with occasional giggle fits in the back.
we both have helped this..very indecisive lady pick out shirts previously
and we both decided it was Mary Ann's turn.
my boss and I are terrible terrible people.
@MaraWritesStuff not unless they were trying to hit on you
@BattleMonkeyz also they were tiny.
@BattleMonkeyz couple of years ago, me and my sister made a snow
couple and they lasted a day.
@BattleMonkeyz if we ever do get snow there won't BE enough for a
snowman. ;w;
@BattleMonkeyz *sobs* i just want winter sosososo bad.
@BattleMonkeyz I feel like I need a shower every time I step outside. it
ain't pleasant.
@Megafighter3 I WAS JUST BEING FRIENDLY AND SHE GOT
OFFENDED.
@Megafighter3 Like..we weren't even arguing about anything. I was
just being silly and she thought I was being condescending.
@BattleMonkeyz In the swamp, it's hot, humid, wet, and gross all year
round.,
@BattleMonkeyz yeah we're just now getting around to the hot side of
fall.
@BattleMonkeyz hahaha it's 63 degrees outside. I'm still running the
AC on full blast.
@ProfessorOtaku yeah, that was our reaction as well. I can't wait to
get out of retail.
@BattleMonkeyz it's too wet to run here.                                    (
@ProfessorOtaku "maybe..uh..you came off as condescending?"
@ProfessorOtaku "wait...that's ALL you said? Really?"
@ProfessorOtaku yeah she was kinda dumbfounded when I told her
about it.
My boss was like "Eh.. I didn't see it as offensive but you kinda need to
watch your tone sometimes"
@BattleMonkeyz Still getting fat. Hahaha. But yes, you're right.
Like.. she was truly offended.
Holy CRAP lady I was trying to be funny.
@BattleMonkeyz I make $8.87 an hour. It's not really a fortune.
A customer asked me what ink was on sale. I said "Ink? HP Ink!" and
she's like "I know it's HP Ink I'm not STUPID"
I was trying to be funny and friendly and it blew up in my face. Turns
out I came off as condescending.
@BattleMonkeyz hahahah actually I'm doing pretty awful but thanks.
Another day, another offended customer.
I wonder why certain groups are against this. Isn't it common sense?
it's not like they're taking them away. https                               //t.co/x9rpJE546f
@BattleMonkeyz calvin yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Too tired to play video games. Is this a part of this quarter life crisis I
keep hearing about?
"Do you have a...thing to go on *gestures to object* y'know..a thing?"
No. Because I have no idea what you're referring to.
i.e. I've already gotten into it with my boss this morning. *sigh*
Today I'm gonna make it be a good day even though it started off
horribly. Wish me luck!
Also starting to get to the point in Fallout 4 where I have to search for
doable side quests. Not that I'm complaining. Exploring is fun.
As cute as cat fetch is, reading time is sacred.
Cat update: Tali thinks reading time is "steal hair tie and make owner
throw it over and over again" time.
@ErinSmi14035528 I tend to switch every mission usually but I tend to
use Hancock and Valentine the most. They don't judge me for hoarding
@ErinSmi14035528 dude I love Danse but only because of the Buzz
Lightyear memes.
@ErinSmi14035528 God no. I'm never that bold, not even on the
Internet. Besides, I'm more of a Nick Valentine fangirl myself.
@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 I think they're funny
despite me being scared of them.
@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 eh honestly I can only
speak for myself. Not gonna lie though...some of the Ghoulettes scare
me
@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 Please, I'm the least
scary person ever.
@ErinSmi14035528 @TheFuxedos @fallenangel460 I'm more of a
lurker than a participator but the Ghoulettes are a special kind of
people.
@TheFuxedos @ErinSmi14035528 @fallenangel460 Twitter's pretty
easy to figure out, specially when there are fun people to talk to--like
us!
@NoahClue oh please...
@NoahClue Imma be honest they look identical.
@NoahClue oh wait it looked like Lucky Star. Hahaha. Man I'm out of
the loop on moe shows.
@NoahClue yknow after all these years I've still never seen an
episode of that accursed show.
@ProfessorOtaku a) I have job security, I'm not gonna do that and b)
she's only a terrible boss if she's in a mood.
Look lady. I am TRYING to stay busy. You're not helping.
Example: you're trying to stay busy and she says "Oh, you're STILL not
done with that?"
What's the least offensive way to ask your boss to stop being
condescending?
@Megafighter3 Oh, I've been feeling it for years, man.
I may be in the least festive spirit in my entire life. Damn you retail.
Lovely. My boss is on a power trip this morning.
@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns I can totally do that. Just gimme a
voice modulator and I can do my Ash Ketchum voice.
*sigh* My cat is a binge eater.
@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns hm. I'll mull over it and get back to
you on that. It's a tempting offer.
@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns I'm in need of some extra
experience, is this a paid internship?
and I don't know why. Is it the bouncing animation? Except I get the
same effect in first pov as well.
I should clarify                                                             watching my character in power armor makes me nautious.
Does wearing power armor in fallout 4 give anyone else motion
sickness or is it just me?
@GlassReflection You've improved a great deal since the last time I
was an avid viewer. Makes me proud                                          ')

half an hour.

his hi tech computer couldn't handle the awesomeness
@atmora get this my sister used her status as the golden child to get
us a ps4 and fallout 4 as an early Christmas present
@Slatefield thanks! It should be all matching!
Honestly I'm more excited to be able to play Fallout 4 for the rest of the
day.
It's not really a big thing for me since I'm going to another school next
semester.
I'm about to take the last test before I graduate with an associates
degree. Yay?
My companion in fallout 4 is judging me for my looting habits. Excuse
you. Some of us need to build things with random crap.
@PikaHikariKT it's too bad she's an ungrateful little brat. She cried and
cried for cream today and when I caved she didn't even drink it.
She literally saved my life you know.
Because, even though I spent a holiday meant to be shared alone. I
am truly thankful for this face. https://t.co/KmYhj00LGO

I used to care too much about others..which lead me to the pits
emotionally; which is where I gladly dwell.
Jus how it is
I love selflessly; its the world that taught me to be an asshole.
I wouldnt care if the world hated me because the love the world tries to
show isnt genuine; its selfish greed attempting gain
Guess i'm just an asshole

Just wanna throw this out there: if you've ever believed in me and you
gave up on me, you're no true supporter. I don't need or want you.
That's who I am. More importantly, that's the world I wanna live in;
that's the world I want my family to live in.
One day i wanna be able to approach a stranger and share love and
have them reciprocate the feeling to others. Stranger to stranger.

did you kill her off!!!!!

anyways clarke loves bellamy and vice verse, she's his best friend and
he's hers and they'd die for each other these are Facts
i think about this a lot in conjunction with the idea that there's many
ways to say you love someone and like .

The #Redskins fans are booing their own play calling. That can't be
good. #MNF #NFL
@OfficialDesiree @desireebackup I want to thank them too. You are
arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet. Merry Christmas.
@jennajameson That's very ignorant of you. How are peaceful Muslims
supposed to control terrorists any more than you can???
I want a hamburger, but I live alone and don't feel like cooking it.

If God gave me the opportunity to go to Heaven right now, I'd take it.
I'm really not happy here on Earth.
@stoney16 He got screwed but he shouldn't have flipped the ball at
the guy. He's such a tool.
Cam Newton is such a tool. #MNF #NFL
@realDonaldTrump I look forward to your #impeachment, sir.
@DonCheadle I'll never understand why people think celebrities can't
voice their opinions about politics. Free speech, mutherfuckas.
@IAMJHUD Your sweater looks nice, but that's probably just because
you're wearing it. Merry Christmas, Song Bird.
We need to unify and get behind @realDonaldTrump? That's not what
they did for Obama. I'm waiting for Donald to get impeached.

I'm 57 years old and have been dealing with bouts of depression since
I was 19 years old. That's a lot of time being depressed.
Sometimes I go for months without smoking any weed. What kind of
medical marijuana advocate am I?
Mom passed away on February 2, 2014 and my life hasn't been the
same since. I miss her.
I feel a song in my heart, but it's singing offkey right now.
Don't tempt fate.
My mind won't shut up and let me go to sleep. I wish I had some warm
milk.
I still can't fall asleep.
I hope I have a good dream tonight.
I wish I had a couple of sleeping pills.

This is it! #Lions. #NFL.
The Lions defense has to step up now! #NFL.

Come on defense. #Lions #NFL
No more turnovers. #Lions #NFL.
Since the #Lions offense can't score a TD, their defense will have to.
The #DetroitLions need to finish off the first half with a touchdown
drive. #NFL.

@marijuanx basically its how all millenials talk what chu goin on abkut
@madreeve thats not what she said
@madreeve you're a huge challenge.
@madreeve his parents got a divorce shortly after. I lost contact with
the rest.
Chances are, if there's symptoms of it, you could treat it earlier before
it spirals into something uncontrollable. Trust in modern medicine
If you see/somehow feel like your children are acting weirdly, please
please please seek help. Jangan lah in-denial.
I told her many times that the kid's not behaving normally. Like he has
some form of autism

Even if he doesn't, wouldn't checking be better
You know what's frustrating? My cousin (his makcik) refusing to accept
the fact that the kid should be sent to a doctor for checkup.
And he took a toy and threw it at the window, smashing it, all because
the other kids were "noisy"

Like. Tf.
Then kindergarten when he was 5. His parents were called by the
school because during playtime, the other kids were playing around
eg. You call his name and he'd look at you for a split second then look
away. Idk. He just seemed to be behaving weirdly for a 4 y/o.
And then he doesn't really throw tantrums? He just likes to do his own
thing. He doesn't respond to affection. Nor to attention.
Whenever people talk, he would cover his ears and then scream
"DIAM. DIAM. BISING" like. We weren't even shouting or anything.
I have a cousin who's autistic. At least. I think he was autistic. He was
4. But he showed signs of having autism.

It's more satisfying when you start from the bottom and make your way
to the top. Instead of just downgrading each time.
You know what. I'm gonna take it easy and start small. Buy a lightsaber
thats cheaper. Then save up money to buy the one that costs 3000.

Shipping sampai 300 ringgit ni is too much for my frugal student ass     (
@Kozilekk it is! Not only did you need to avoid touching the fuse box
by holding it at a specific angle, it also has a bigger lower grip.
A year of being my dad's golf caddy has taught me that anything that
needs to be held with a firm grip, should be made smooth &amp;
unobstructed
Its actually a very poorly designed saber though. Lol. The activation
switch is that big, rectangular box. It restricts the grip and motion.

@anashssn how to expand my albino army liddis. I dunwan non-albino
children (lol who am I kidding. Siapa je nak anak dia albino. Nope)
@loofranchot STOP
@anashssn no Anas. A doctor who studied albinism already debunked
this. She said its not even a 50% chance. Not sure how though

@SW1128 I think ASB is the cheapest broker and it's a minimum $30
per trade. Smart shares you pay a percentage of your investment no
minimum
@SW1128 but the smart money is always on index funds. A Random
Walk Down Wall Street is a good book to read
@SW1128 low as costs due to the fact they're all index funds.
Minimum $500 buy in. Minimum $50 regular contribution
@SW1128 and yea smart shares is the shit. If you're wanting to get
into individual stock picking though it's not suitable
@SW1128 a few rules of thumb are typically all you need
@SW1128 asset allocation would all depend on your own goals and
I've never personally read anything touching on this topic.

starting work... My going home countdown begins!
@LindaCurley37 Look harder! Stat!
@LindaCurley37 Can you go back and watch epi 1?
@LindaCurley37 What? How did you miss epi 1? But you'll love the
rest!
@MaddyTran1 But I hope you enjoyed your time off!
@MaddyTran1 Well it's sad for me every week and I had no winter
break!
Thank goodness it's Friday! Let me get through this workday so I can
take a nap!
@LindaCurley37 Did you enjoy it? It's so good! Even better to come!
@MiloVentimiglia You can make it a tradition and water the lawn
again... Just sayin.                                                        )
@LindaCurley37 Huh? What's that?
@lee6358 Annoying right?
@LindaCurley37 Um... looks like u should send me a New Years gift!!!
          . Kidding.
I hate it when my Apple Watch tells me to stand up... I can't really do
that sitting in LA traffic.
@LindaCurley37 @JCxAlways Is that a U.K. thing?            it's still awesome!
@JCxAlways Lol. What's on top of the hat? A ball of puff?
#Lakers on tonight! Let's get the "W" LA!
@cappysun Lol. True, true! I'll accept that! ✌️☺️
@cappysun and you know who is in charge? HR! They never let you
do anything you want to!
@cappysun I'm not that large, and not that in charge (only in my own
head I am). And my job is not that serious.
@JCxAlways It must have been picked up from the educational E
channel! Nite!
@JCxAlways Sure. Okay. Um. Yea.
@lee6358 Fingers crossed!
@JCxAlways Oh my goodness! Watch an educational documentary.
STAT!!!
@JCxAlways Haha... aren't Heidi and Spencer American?
@lee6358 That's good.
@JCxAlways What are you watching?
@lee6358 It's still something!
@lee6358 Seriously.
@lee6358 Yup! But hey! You found a job?
HR emailed, called, and texted me on my work cell phone. When I
finally responded, it wasn't even anything important! And it's my day
off!
@LindaCurley37 Thanks! It's going. Just need to get through 3 more
hours!
@LindaCurley37 I didn't even have 2 weeks off. It's just grim. . But
have fun at work tomorrow!!!
@lee6358 Thanks. That makes me feel better.
Am I one of the few people who has to work today?
I've physically been lazing in bed all day and just realized it is past
2pm.
Happy New Year!!! Now I can go to sleep!
@lee6358 @19_Joanne_87 I have 3 more hours... but I might fall
asleep by then! I'm exhausted.
@lee6358 @19_Joanne_87 Happy New Year! https                                //t.co/ucZtqiONlo
@19_Joanne_87 Also, my friend is mad... I cancelled on going out
tonight! I'm sooooo tired! I wanna celebrate by staying in and sleep!
@19_Joanne_87 Girl, it's only 8pm here and I wanna go to bed!
@LindaCurley37 I'm hoping! And yours as well!
@LindaCurley37 Happy New Year Linda!
@JCxAlways Happy New Year! May 2017 be filled with amazingness
for you!!!
@JCxAlways Yup! My friend keeps texting me things so we can do
tomorrow and I keep vetoing! I want to sleep and chillax!
@19_Joanne_87 Still good for you though!
@19_Joanne_87 Now you just have to spend money on a bunch of
extra bands! Woohoo!!!
@19_Joanne_87 I just bought one! And then o ordered a bunch of
different bands from Amazon.
@lee6358 I don't accomplish things I need to at home either cuz I'm
usually tired from not accomplishing things at work!
I don't think I accomplished anything I needed to at work today.
@LindaCurley37 Woohoo! I'll take it!
@LindaCurley37 I have more shame... only 6/20.
@lee6358 Looks freezing!
@lee6358 Currently here in LA we are at a cool 49 degrees f! Not bad.
@LindaCurley37 Indeed I will!!! Except I'll hold off the drinking part until
after morning.
Merry Merry Christmas everyone!!!
@LindaCurley37 True!!!
@JCxAlways That's me!!! Lol!!!
@LindaCurley37 Lol. Somehow I don't think you'll be getting
heatstroke!
@LindaCurley37 Yes and Yes! I actually have no clue where my
umbrellas are! We rarely have rain!
@19_Joanne_87 Merry Xmas Jo! Hope you have a great holiday!
@lee6358 I was too lazy to get another blanket so I grabbed another
sweater instead and am wearing layers!
51 degrees and rain... I'm sooooo cold!

#WeakSauceFromLAWhoIsNotUseToTheCold
@monixdecastro I'm hoping when I'm leaving work in Century City to
DTLA in a few, it'll be traffic free!
@JCxAlways I need to finish shopping!
@lee6358 Tru dat! But I just ate so that makes me happy now!
@MaddyTran1 Girl! I be hungry and I ain't gonna make something for
myself!
@MaddyTran1 I'm gonna get out now! Finally! Meeting a friend for
lunch.
@LindaCurley37 Just like me! I ignore my mom too!
@LindaCurley37 And it's raining outside. I like staying in bed when it
rains.
@LindaCurley37 Glad my mom doesn't say that to me!
@LindaCurley37 I've been up since 7am. I just haven't left my bed!
@lee6358 Butt is physically still in bed. I'm so lazy! So tired from work
but glad I have today off. But running errands is like work!
I really need to get out of the comforts of my warm bed and go last
minute xmas shopping.
@JCxAlways Only if you are doing phone deliveries!
@JCxAlways I'm bot exactly sure curry will help though!
@LindaCurley37 Woohoo! 9/10 and these versions of games are U.K.
Versions! But some are still similar!
@JCxAlways Great job lady! Also love the song!
@RobKyker Sure! What up! Merry Xmas!
@LindaCurley37 Good luck too!!!
@LindaCurley37 Me too! Doing cards this weekend!
@LindaCurley37 I'm doing all my XMas errands today. Last minute
gifts. Post office run...
@bengleib I think you accidentally followed me... But I actually met ur
folks in LA shopping mall once! They were speaking of u proudly!
@LindaCurley37 Darn it!
@JCxAlways Buddy!!! Stop!!!
@JCxAlways So true!
